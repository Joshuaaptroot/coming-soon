<div id="paragraph">
    <p>Having spent the last few years working as a Tech recruiter, I was fortunate enough to speak hundreds of developers at every level. I spoke with Juniors taking their first steps, to Technical Directors starting their second companies. I learned about the new tools being created, the technological developments, the most used coding languages, the pros and cons of being a developer, and much more. With every conversation, my interest in Software Development grew, and it wasn't long before I was starting online courses and watching youtube videos, taking my own first step towards learning how to code. </p>
    <p>Growing up, I never really knew what I was good at or what I wanted to do; I enjoyed every subject in a different way. Whilst it may sound like a blessing, as a child I was given the impression that you would inevitably give up on some subjects to pursue others, meaning I eventually dropped two interests of mine - Maths and Art. Whilst I enjoyed both immensely, they seemed too mutually exclusive, were I to work in one there would be no option to engage in the other, so I decided to leave them both as hobbies and interests, and didn't look back.</p>
    <p>Only when I started to learn about coding in greater depth, through the conversations I had with developers, did I realise that coding could be an incredible fusion of maths and creativity, front end or back end, you were using logic and equations to create something new. Upon realising this, I was both excited and dissapointed. Excited because I knew I wanted to learn more about this, having never even really known what coding was before. Dissapointed, simply because I hadn't learnt about it sooner, and was now a recent graduate with all my expected education done.</p>
    <p>My interest has never waned, and I have now spent a significant portion of my time ouside of work, for the last 2 years, learning the basics of coding. Unfortunately, Recruitment is a tough, sales oriented industry, and naturally this meant working 10-11 hour days more commonly than not, meaning I really didn't have the time to balance Work, development and my social life</p>
    <p>In January 2023, I realised I needed to make a decision. It was impossible to maintain the work standards necessary to succeed in recruitment, and seriously engage with web/software development; a hobby that was growing towards a real passion. So, come February, I quit to apply myself full time to the pursuit of my first course in the Technology sphere! What time I haven't spent applying, I've also spent compounding on my exisitng skills, meeting with other budding developers and discussing how to break into this industry. It seems apparent to me, that I would benefit most form guidance from a senior developer, and if there is an opportunity for me to learn from those in work currently, I would take in a heart beat.</p>
    <p>I will diarise my experience here, but I've only just started! right now, I have a firm grasp on HTML, CSS and JS, whilst the last of the three is taking a bit more time, hopefully with a bit of work we'll be an expert soon! </p>
